# 📈 Market Data Warehouse Modelling Layer

Production-style financial data warehouse built using **BigQuery + SQL** to standardise market data modelling, KPI definitions, and analytical governance.

---

## 🚀 Project Summary

Financial institutions rely on trusted market datasets to power analytics, research, and trading decisions.  
This project simulates a **Bloomberg-style market data modelling layer**, transforming raw pricing data into governed, analytics-ready financial metrics.

The warehouse ensures:
- Consistent KPI definitions
- Scalable analytical querying
- Reliable financial reporting
- Reusable data models

## 🧱 Warehouse Modelling Approach

### ⭐ Staging Layer
Standardises raw financial datasets:
- Data type cleaning
- Timestamp alignment
- Naming conventions

### ⭐ Dimension Models
Reusable business entities:
- `dim_asset`
- `dim_date`

### ⭐ Fact Tables
Core analytical dataset:
- `fct_market_prices`

Designed for scalable time-series analysis.

### ⭐ Metrics Layer
Centralised financial KPIs:
- Daily Returns
- Moving Averages
- Price Trends
- Volume Indicators

Acts as a **single source of analytical truth**.

## ✅ Data Governance

Validation queries enforce warehouse reliability:

- Null value checks  
- Duplicate detection  
- Referential integrity validation  
- Data consistency monitoring  

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimisation

Warehouse optimisation techniques include:

- Partitioned time-series tables
- Clustered analytical dimensions
- Query cost reduction strategies
- Modular transformation logic
