# Market Data Warehouse Modelling Layer

## Overview
This project implements a production-style financial data warehouse modelling layer designed to standardise market data KPIs and enable consistent analytical reporting.

The warehouse simulates institutional market data environments similar to those used in financial data platforms, where pricing data must be reliable, scalable, and governed before consumption by analytics teams.

---

## Project Objectives
- Standardise financial KPI definitions across datasets
- Design reusable fact and dimension models
- Optimise analytical queries for large-scale market data
- Implement validation checks for data governance
- Provide clean, analytics-ready datasets

---

## Architecture

Raw Market Data  
→ Staging Layer  
→ Dimension Models  
→ Fact Tables  
→ KPI / Metrics Layer  
→ Validation & Governance  

---

## Data Model

### Fact Tables
- `fct_market_prices` — daily asset price observations

### Dimension Tables
- `dim_asset` — asset metadata (ticker, sector, exchange)
- `dim_date` — calendar attributes for time-based analytics

---

## KPI Layer
Reusable financial metrics built from governed warehouse models:

- Daily Returns
- Moving Averages
- Price Trends
- Volume Indicators

These KPIs act as a **single source of truth** for downstream reporting.

---

## Data Governance & Validation
Validation queries ensure warehouse reliability:

- Not-null constraints
- Duplicate detection
- Referential integrity checks
- Data consistency validation

---

## Technology Stack
- Google BigQuery
- SQL
- Python (data ingestion)
- GitHub
- GitHub Actions (CI)


## Example Analytical Use Case
Analysts can directly query curated KPI tables to evaluate asset performance without redefining business logic, improving reporting consistency and reducing analytical duplication.

---

## Future Improvements
- Incremental data loading
- Automated scheduling
- dbt implementation
- Dashboard integration (Power BI / Looker Studio)
